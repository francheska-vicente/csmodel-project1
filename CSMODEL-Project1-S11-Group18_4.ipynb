    "This dataset contains the Top 500 most powerful non-distributed computer systems or supercomputers in the world. \n",

    "To objectively rank the performance of these computer systems, the **LINPACK Benchmark** is used. The benchmark measures the floating-point rate of execution of a computer where the computer is tasked to solve a complex system of linear equations. While it is not a complete indicator of the overall performance of a computer system, it is still accurate in estimating peak performance.\n",

    "#### Is there a significant relationship between a supercomputer's `Process Technology` and the `Segment` of the industry it belongs in?\n",
    "A supercomputer is a computer that performs at or near the currently highest operational rate for computers. Supercomputers are akin to a cluster of normal computers working together. Supercomputing has always been a specialized form at the cutting edge of computing. Its share of overall computing has decreased as computing has become ubiquitous. Many important applications need better local memory bandwidth and lower apparent latency, as well as better global bandwidth and latency. For future supercomputers, this might a big hint to know if there is a relationship between segment of industry and the process technology. \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is there a significant difference between the means of the `Rmax [TFlop/s]` of the professional sectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "In high-performance computing, Rmax and Rpeak are scores used to rank supercomputers based on their performance using the LINPACK Benchmark. A system's Rmax score describes its maximal achieved performance; the Rpeak score describes its theoretical peak performance. Values for both scores are usually represented in teraFLOPS or petaFLOPS. The Linpack Benchmark is a measure of a computer’s floating-point rate of execution. It is determined by running a computer program that solves a dense system of linear equations. Over the years the characteristics of the benchmark has changed a bit. Professional sectors such as academic, government, industry and research were chosen becuase these are the majority of the data of segment. Also, these four sectors are the main driving factors of the development of the nation. \n",

    "# Statistical Inference\n",
    "In order for us to find the answer to our research questions, we have to undergo the process of statistical inference. In this notebook, statistical inference for means and for categorical data would be both utilized, especifically ANOVA and Two-way Table that uses Chi Square Statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Rmax` of Supercomputers across Professional `Segments` of the Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Data Pre-processing\n",
    "Because the `Rmax [TFlop/s]` column is a continuous numerical data, we need to check if there is an outlier in the data. The interquartile range (IQR) is used to remove the outliers by setting a limit around the dataset's first quartile (*Q1*) and third quartile (*Q3*). This means that the range of the `Rmax [TFlop/s]` would be 1.5 times times the IQR lower than the Q1 to the 1.5 times IQR higher than Q3."

In this scenario, it is better to drop the outliers as we want to find out about if there is a significant difference between the `Rmax [TFlop/s]` value of the supercomputers of the `Segments`. As such, having outliers might greatly affect the mean of a group, which would result to the value of its mean not representing the whole of its sample group."
