The benchmark measures the floating-point rate of execution of a computer where the computer is tasked to solve a complex system of linear equations. While it is not a complete indicator of the overall performance of a computer system, it is still accurate in estimating peak performance.\n",

Naturally, the data is carefully verified with the original manufacturers and in some cases, contact is established with the installation site.
